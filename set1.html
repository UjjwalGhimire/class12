				You want to be healthy. You know, you need to exercise more. But if you are not ready to grunt through an hour of kick-boxing, don't <b>despair</b>. There is a growing agreement among exercise researchers that the intense physical activities offered by most health clubs are not the only–or even the preferable–path to better health. Indeed, the best thing for most of us may be to just walk.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				Yes, walk. At a <b>reasonable</b> vigorous clip (five to six km/h) for half an hour or so, may be <i>five or six times a week</i>. You may not feel the benefits all at once, but the evidence suggests that over the long term, a regular walking routine can do a world of preventive good.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				Walking, in fact, may be the perfect exercise. For starters, it's one of the safest things you can do with your body. It's much easier on the knees than running and doesn't trigger untoward side effects. Dr.Johnna Manson, chief of <b>preventive</b> medicine at a leading Harvard woman's hospital says, "If everyone were to walk briskly 30 minutes a day, we could cut the incidence of many chronic diseases by 30 to 40 per cent." She further says, ''Regular physical activity is probably as close to <u>a magic bullet</u> as we will come in modern medicine."
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				And for those of us who don't have half-hour chunks of time, the news gets even better. Several recent studies suggest that walking <b>briskly</b> three or four times a day for 10 minutes at a time may provide many of the same benefits as walking continuously for 30 minutes.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				Here's how to make the most of your walking routine. First, get into gear. Walker's shoes need to have enough room at the front for the feet to spread. Then, ease on down that road. Avoid <b>muscle</b> aches by starting slowly and incorporating gentle stretches into both your warmup and cool down. You must plot your course. Some people walk at a specific time each day. Others shoehorn walking into their routines by parking the car a few minutes from the store or taking the stairs instead of the lift. Record your efforts, including how long and how far you walked. Jotting down improvements keeps you motivated and challenges you to do better.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				Since walking affects you in so many ways at once, it's difficult to <b>determine</b> precisely why it's good for you. But much of the evidence <b>gathered</b> so far is compelling.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				Brisk walking is good for the heart—which makes a lot of sense. The heart is a muscle after all, and anything that makes the blood flow faster through a muscle helps keep it in shape. But regular walking also lowers blood pressure, which decreases the stress on the arteries. It can boost the amount of HDL cholesterol (the good one) in our blood. It even seems to make the blood less "sticky", and therefore less likely to produce unwanted clots. This all adds up to as much as a 50 per cent reduction in the risk of suffering a heart attack.

		Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>In A Devoted Son, Rakesh’s success became a topic of discussion because he was the first in his family and community to achieve high academic distinction, topping the country in his medical exams. His humility in caring for his aging parents, despite his professional success, further elevated him in the eyes of his neighbors, as it went against expectations of how successful children often behave.</b><br><br>

      b. Describe the irritating things that the people do with the strange old man. (<i>A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings</i>)<br>
      Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>In A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings, the villagers treat the strange old man poorly, displaying both curiosity and cruelty. They crowd around him, poking him with sticks to make him move, and treating him more like a sideshow attraction than a human being. They throw food at him and gawk at his strange wings, showing little empathy or respect for his condition. Their constant disturbances reflect their lack of understanding and disregard for his dignity.</b><br><br>

      Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Marriage, as a social institution, is a legally and culturally recognized union between individuals, often built on love, commitment, and mutual responsibilities. It establishes the foundation for forming a family, passing on traditions, and providing social and emotional support. Throughout history, marriage has been shaped by various cultural, religious, and economic factors, reinforcing social bonds and influencing individual identity and social structure.</b><br><br>

			a. &nbsp; Explain the following lines with reference to the context. (I was My Own Route) 
         And I was all in me as was life in me...<br><br>
         I wanted to be like men wanted me to be:<br>
         an attempt at life;<br>
         a game of hide and seek with my being.<br>
         But I was made of nows;<br>
         when the heralds announced me<br>
         at the regal parade of the old guard,<br>
         the desire to follow men warped in me,<br>
         and the homage was left waiting for me.<br>
         Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>In these lines from the poem I Was My Own Route by Julia de Burgos, the speaker reflects on the struggle between conforming to societal expectations and embracing her authentic self. The first part, "I wanted to be like men wanted me to be: an attempt at life; a game of hide and seek with my being," highlights how she once tried to live according to the roles imposed on her by society, particularly by men. This conformity is depicted as an incomplete, superficial existence, like playing a game that hides her true essence.<br><br>
         The second part, "But I was made of nows; when the heralds announced me... the desire to follow men warped in me," signifies a turning point. The speaker realizes that she is made of the present moment, fully alive and self-aware. When society expected her to conform ("the regal parade of the old guard"), she resisted, and her desire to follow those traditional paths faded ("warped in me"). The "homage left waiting" represents the unfulfilled expectations of society, as the speaker chooses her own path rather than adhering to others' demands.<br><br>
         These lines emphasize the speaker's journey toward self-liberation and rejecting societal norms to embrace her own identity.</b><br><br>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR<br><br>
         &nbsp; Sketch the character of Monsieur Durand. (Facing Death)<br>
         Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Monsieur Durand, a central character in Facing Death by August Strindberg, is portrayed as a worn-out, self-sacrificing figure. He is a widower and the father of three ungrateful daughters, struggling to keep them fed and clothed despite their lack of appreciation. A former railway official, Durand now runs a small, failing boarding house to support his family. He is deeply burdened by his financial situation and the sense of duty to provide for his daughters, who treat him with disrespect.<br><br>
         Durand is a man of integrity, refusing to take immoral or dishonest paths to improve his finances. He is deeply selfless, giving everything for his daughters' well-being, even though they are unkind and ungrateful. His quiet endurance of suffering, combined with his moral strength, paints him as a tragic figure, ultimately facing despair and contemplating death as a way out of his misery. His character symbolizes sacrifice, dignity, and the pain of being unappreciated by those he loves.</b><br><br>

         b. How does the play make a satire on feudal system of Nepali society of late 18th century? (The Bull)<br>
         Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The play The Bull by Bhimnidhi Tiwari satirizes the feudal system of late 18th-century Nepali society by exposing the exploitation, corruption, and blind loyalty embedded within the social hierarchy. The play centers around a bull that belongs to a feudal lord, symbolizing the unchecked power and control that landlords had over the peasants and common folk.<br><br>
         In the play, the bull, despite causing chaos and destruction, cannot be restrained or punished because it is the property of the powerful feudal lord. This reflects the feudal structure where the elite class is above the law, while the poor and powerless must endure suffering without recourse. The common people, including the farmer whose crops are destroyed, are left helpless, unable to demand justice due to the oppressive system that favors the rich and influential.<br><br>
         Additionally, the play highlights the absurdity of blind loyalty to the feudal lords, as the people are forced to respect and obey the bull simply because of its connection to power. This satirical portrayal critiques the feudal system’s inherent injustice and the way it perpetuates inequality and exploitation, with the lower classes remaining subservient to the whims of the elite. Through humor and exaggeration, The Bull illustrates the absurdity and cruelty of the feudal system in late 18th-century Nepali society.</b>

				Madhav Prasad Ghimire is a renowned Nepali poet who has given a great contribution to Nepali literature. He is one of the last of the oldest generation of poets in Nepal. He was motivated by the works of Rabindranath Tagore. He is a poet of the romantic tradition.He has written many incredible books such as Gauri, Malati Mangale, Himal Pari Himal Wari, Aswathama, Rajheswari, and Shakuntala and he is well known for his inspiring works. He was honoured as Rashtra Kavi (poet of the nation) of Nepal. He is undoubtedly one of the rare poets in Nepal to gain fame and fortune, and not the unfortunate forgetfulness they normally receive.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
				But the greatest asset of his life is its simplicity. He is a very simple person with a simple taste, but his verses are varied and complex. However, for some, he is a Himalayan poet and for some the poet of love and harmony. However, this truth cannot be denied: he is a lyric poet and one of the true servants of Nepali literature.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
            It is also a national treasure associated with the golden age of Nepali literature. He is one of the last of the oldest generation of poets whose contemporaries, Bal Krishna Sama and Laxmi Prasad Devkota, have become historical figures in the annals of Nepali literature.
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
            It is known that in his masterpieces such as Gauri and Malati Mangale he portrayed terrible truths of society. This literature was most praised by the Nepali people. Some of his other important literary works include Himal Pari Himal Wari, Rajeshwori, Aswathama, and Shakuntala which are most appreciated.
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
            He is a simple man with a complex and different perception. Rastra Kavi Ghimire was cited as a source of inspiration in the Nepali literary brotherhood. Not only writing but also his will to live has inspired many Nepali people. According to him, there are three mantras to live longer; Easy exercise or yoga, positive thinking, and creativity.
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
            For him, education in his own life is very important, since it takes a person from darkness to light and it is very important that Nepali youth should learn these things from him. He is respected by the people of Nepal.
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
             "I think poets should be able to go beyond the social hierarchy and bring visions to humanity, and by using their poetic abilities, they should be able to expand the mind and pursue the truth.", this is a great sentence by Madhav Prasad Ghimire.

			Answer: &nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<b>Dear [Cousin’s Name],<br><br>

         I hope this letter finds you well! I recently finished reading a novel that I believe you would really enjoy: "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern. I wanted to share my thoughts with you because it left a lasting impression on me.<br><br>

         The novel is set in a magical, mysterious circus that opens only at night, and it's unlike anything I've ever read. What I loved most about it is how vividly Morgenstern describes the enchanting world of the circus, making it feel so real and immersive. The plot revolves around a fierce competition between two young illusionists, which adds an intriguing layer of suspense and romance to the story.<br><br>

         The characters are wonderfully developed, and the lyrical prose creates a captivating atmosphere. Each chapter is like a new act in the circus, full of wonder and surprise. If you enjoy fantasy with a touch of romance and a rich, imaginative setting, I think this book would be perfect for you.<br><br>

		<b>6. &nbsp; 'Privatization in education creates two class citizens.' To what extent do you agree with this opinion? Write an essay in about 300 words on why you think so shading light on pros and cons of privatizing education, issues and Government responsibilities. (10)</b><br>
		Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp; 
		<b>Privatization in education has sparked considerable debate regarding its impact on social equity. The opinion that privatization creates two-class citizens is one that merits serious consideration. While privatization can offer several benefits, it also poses significant challenges that can exacerbate social inequality.<br><br>

      Advantages (Pros) of Privatizing Education:<br><br>

      Increased Efficiency: Privatization often leads to improved efficiency and innovation. Private institutions can be more flexible and responsive to market demands, introducing modern teaching methods and curricula that may be more effective.<br><br>

      Enhanced Quality: Competition among private schools can drive up standards, offering students access to high-quality education and resources that might not be available in public schools.<br><br>

      Parental Choice: Privatization allows parents to choose schools that align with their values and educational preferences, potentially leading to more personalized learning experiences for their children.<br><br>

      Disadvantages (Cons) of Privatizing Education:<br><br>

      Increased Inequality: One of the most significant drawbacks is that privatization can deepen existing educational inequalities. Wealthier families can afford to send their children to well-resourced private schools, while those from lower-income backgrounds may be left with underfunded public schools.<br><br>

      Accessibility Issues: Privatization can lead to a lack of access for disadvantaged students, creating a disparity in educational opportunities based on socio-economic status.<br><br>

      Quality Disparities: Not all private schools maintain high standards. The variation in quality can mean that while some students receive excellent education, others may not, perpetuating educational inequality.<br><br>

      Government Responsibilities:<br><br>

      To address these issues, governments have a crucial role in ensuring that privatization does not undermine public education. They must implement regulations to maintain quality standards in both private and public schools. Additionally, governments should provide support and subsidies to make private education more accessible to low-income families and invest in public schools to ensure that they are not left behind.<br><br>

      In conclusion, while privatization can enhance educational quality and efficiency, it also risks creating a two-class system where only the affluent can access superior education. Balancing privatization with strong governmental oversight and support for public education is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure equitable access to quality education for all students.</b>
